# License Terms
- The original creator, user [jasonhe54][OC_GitHub] on GitHub, maintains full ownership of the source code, and can do whatever with it, including, but not limited to, redistributing, copying, referencing, and reuploading the project, in parts, or as a whole.
- The GitHub account hosting a forked version of the original project, which is likely the same as the original version, specifically user [Info-HICC][Info-HICC_GitHub] on GitHub, but includes all other users who create a fork does not have ownership, of any sort, over the source code. Rather, the code is licenced for free to said user to deploy and use on Slack by the original creator. This license does not grant the ability to, among other things, redistribute the code for the app, reuploading or sharing any part of the app, or the ability to move the code into an alternative account, or anything that constitutes usage of the original project without prior approval from the original creator.
- Any third-party users who are not mentioned above are subjected to the following terms (given that this repository is made publicly viewable):
    - Third-party users may use portions of the code for reference, but may not copy or use entire sections including, but not limited to, blocks of comments, exact variable names, and exact environmental variable names, EXCEPT for when those blocks of code or variable names are found on the internet, or otherwise publicly available for reference from other sources. Such examples include, but are not limited to, Node.JS module names, and their respective variable names, the function structure to make an API call to Slack's API using Slack Bolt, or anything that isn't created by the original creator, but instead makes use of other tools (like modules).
- This applies to all users who use this project in any form:
    - Including a reference to this license, and/or project inside your project, (whether as a link or direct mention), is optional, but appreciated.  



- No other abilities are granted by this license, other than those mentioned above.
- Limitations mentioned above are **NOT** all inclusive, and limitations not mentioned should **NOT** be considered as or treated like permission. 
    - If a limitation is not mentioned above, check in with the original creator to get express permission. (You can always create another repository, and mention the original creator inside an issue to get a reply. Just make sure it's clear what you're asking for, and reference this license file/project.)
- Breaking the terms specified in this licence could result in takedowns. If you are unsure if you can do something, ASK.
