            <b><li>Step 1</li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>. Make sure you're logged into the right account.</li>
            </ul>
            <b><li>Step 2</li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Along the left sidebar, near the top, you will see a plus icon with the word "New". Press that, and upload your image file. If you're on an iPad using the Google Drive app, the plus icon is along the lower right.</li>
                <li><img class="imgWidth" src="https://slack-requestapp.herokuapp.com/static/img4.png" alt="Image with box around a Google Drive button saying &quot;New&quot; with a plus sign."></li>
            </ul>
            <b><li>Step 3</li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Once you've uploaded the image, you can find it using the search bar and search for the name, or using the "Recent" tab along the left.</li>
            </ul>
            <b><li>Step 4</li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Once you've found the image, press the plus icon near the top right. It's a icon with a human, and a plus next to it. This will open a popup that shows the sharing settings for the file.</li>
                <li><img class="imgWidth" src="https://slack-requestapp.herokuapp.com/static/img5.png" alt="Image with box around &quot;Share&quot; icon."></li>
            </ul>
            <b><li>Step 5</li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Look near the bottom of the prompt, where it says "General Access", set "Restricted" to "Anyone with the Link". Look to the right of that, it should say "Viewer". If it says "Editor" or "Commenter", unless it's what you want, set it to "Viewer".</li>
                <li><img class="imgWidth" src="https://slack-requestapp.herokuapp.com/static/img6.png" alt="Image showing what it looks like when a file is restricted, and where to press when you want to change the file permissions."></li>
            </ul>
            <b><li>Step 6</li></b>
            <ul>
                <li>At the very bottom left of the popup, press "Copy Link" and then paste that link into the Google Forms submission. If you need to upload multiple images, create a folder in Google Drive, and put all the images into that folder, then follow the same steps above to set the folder to be Viewable by anyone with link (not the individual images). Then paste the link to that folder into the Google Form.</li>
